## üíª Quick Start

```python
from quantum_kernel_system import QuantumKernelSystem

# Initialize the system
qks = QuantumKernelSystem(
    n_qubits=6,  # Must be even for stabilizer code
    error_rate=0.02,
    correction_threshold=0.15
)

# Generate sample data
import numpy as np
X = np.random.uniform(-np.pi, np.pi, size=(10, 6))

# Compute kernel matrix with error correction
kernel_matrix = qks.compute_kernel_matrix(X)

# Analyze error correction performance
analysis = qks.analyze_error_correction()
qks.visualize_error_correction()
```

## üìä Output Interpretation

### Quantum Kernel Matrix
- Heatmap visualization shows quantum state similarities
- Color intensity indicates kernel values:
  * Bright (yellow): High similarity (~1.0)
  * Medium (green/blue): Moderate similarity (0.2-0.6)
  * Dark (purple): Low similarity or anti-correlation (-0.4)
- Diagonal patterns indicate self-similarity
- Off-diagonal patterns show quantum state relationships

### Error Correction Statistics
- Error Rate: Initial error occurrence frequency
- Correction Rate: Frequency of attempted corrections
- Success Rate: Percentage of successful error corrections
- Historical tracking of correction applications
